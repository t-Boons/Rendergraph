# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

Rendering systems with high complexity are hard to manage which leads to bugs and unreadable code.
That's why we have Rendergraphs to mitigate this issue, along with other optimizations that the use of a Rendergraph will bring to you if used in your rendering pipeline.
In this blog I will be explaining how I designed and implemented a simple Rendergraph system into my DirectX 12 renderer called Butterfly.
baseurl: "/Rendergraph" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "https://t-boons.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
